    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A hamburger or burger is an American fast food. It is a type of sandwich
      with a patty of cooked ground meat between the two halves of a bun.
      Tomatoes, onions, cheese, salad and dips may also be added. The hamburger
      may be eaten without a knife and fork, so it is a fast food which can be
      eaten anywhere.
